# Intro

I love fudge. There. I said it. Sometimes I like to reward myself with a little
bit after work. Today I did exactly that, except that when I arrived at the
kitchen I didn't have any.

> Zut alors!

No fear. We can make some! And the best bit? It doesn't involve any scalding hot
saucepans full of sugar. _This_ fudge only requires two minutes in the microwave
and an hour in the fridge[^1].

# Sounds great, what ingredients do I need?

For a medium[^2] amount of fudge you will need:

    | Command                    | Amount    |
    | -------------------------- | --------- |
    | Milk Chocolate             | 400 grams |
    | Condensed Milk             | 400 grams |
    | Microwavable Bowl          | One       |
    | Stirring Spoon             | One       |
    | Chopped Walnuts (optional) | Handful   |

To store your fudge you will want another dish (deep and square) and some grease
proof paper.

# Recipe

## Step One

Break up the chocolate into small bits. Mix with the condensed milk in the
microwaveable bowl, then place in the microwave for a minute.

Take the bowl out of the microwave and stir, mixing in the walnuts. If the
chocolate hasn't quite melted give it another minute in the microwave.

## Step 2

Line a dish with greaseproof paper and pour the mixture in. Leave to set in the
fridge for an hour.

Once it's set you can take it out of the dish and cut it into small squares.
Store in the fridge when not consuming!

[^1]: Now, because this is _two minute fudge_ we are cutting some corners. The

    fudge needs to be chilled to maintain it's consistency. You have been
    warned.

[^2]: Medium people deserve a medium amount of fudge.
