[Restic](https://restic.net) is a nifty backup tool written using
[GOLANG](https://golang.org/). It can encrypt backups, do deduplication and is
compatible with all common cloud provider's storage offerings. Here we will be
backing up super important data to [BackBlaze
B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html).

[BackBlaze B2 Cloud Storage](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/) is pretty
great. the company are open and up front [about their
costs](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage-pricing.html) and publish a
regular [report on drive stats](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/). The idea of
using backblaze here for me is simple - I already back up locally but want to
make sure that my data is also stored safely off site. I don't ever intend to
have to download it from backblaze but it's nice to know it's there.

### Installing Restic

The Restic maintainers offer a [binary
release](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases) from their repository. It's
also available to install in Ubuntu using package managers if that's your thing.

## Installing using APT

On Ubuntu Restic is available using apt, commonly a version or two behind the
current release.

From your terminal:

```bash
# Find restic version in apt
apt search restic

# Install restic using apt
sudo apt install restic
```

## Installing using SNAP

If you are a snap fan you may install the [snap
package](https://snapcraft.io/restic):

# Preparing a Repository

Restic calls backups `repositories` .
