# Intro

Rundeck is an opensource project; it allows you to turn scripts and playbooks
into self service jobs. It has a [full featured
API](https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/api/rundeck-api.html) but there isn't much
online about using it. This post will provide a few examples of using it to
interact with Rundeck projects, their settings and jobs.

We'll also briefly go over using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to
manage project life cycles and project settings.

All code is a available in a [github
repository](https://github.com/markopolo123/rundeck-terraform-api).

# Prerequisites
* Rundeck, with an user and valid auth token.
* curl - for poking rundeck
* jq - for manipulating JSON
* Terraform - for creating projects
# Create a Rundeck project with Terraform

In Rundeck a project is the container object for a set of jobs and the
configuration for which servers those jobs can be run on.

The [Terraform Rundeck
Provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/rundeck/index.html) supports
managing the following objects:

* rundeck_acl_policy
* rundeck_job
* rundeck_project
* rundeck_private_key
* rundeck_public_key

## Specifying Ansible as a resource model

Each Rundeck project can have it's own inventory of hosts. You may also use
Ansible inventories and `ansible_facts` as a source of truth for your Rundeck
project inventories.

In this example we are adding two resource models to a project:

* local
* Ansible

```bash expand="Show"
resource "rundeck_project" "anvils" {
  name        = "anvils"
  description = "Application for managing Anvils"

  ssh_key_storage_path = "path-here"
  resource_model_source {

    type = "local"
    config = {

    }

  }

  resource_model_source {

    type = "com.batix.rundeck.plugins.AnsibleResourceModelSourceFactory"

    config = {
      format                   = "resourcexml"
      ansible-gather-facts     = "true"
      ansible-ignore-errors    = "true"
      ansible-config-file-path = "/ansible/config/path"
      ansible-inventory        = "/ansible/inventory/path"

    }

  }
}

```

## Adding config not explictly supported by the provider

Adding extra config not specifically supported by the provider is pretty easy,
thanks to the `extra_config` option.

From the docs:

> `extra_config` - (Optional) Behind the scenes a Rundeck project is really an
> arbitrary set of key/value pairs. This map argument allows setting any
> configuration properties that aren't explicitly supported by the other
> arguments described above, but due to limitations in Terraform the key names
> must be written with slashes in place of dots. Do not use this argument to set
> properties that the above arguments set, or undefined behavior will result.

Here's an example, setting the default group expansion setting:

```bash
resource "rundeck_project" "anvils" {
  name        = "anvils"
  description = "Application for managing Anvils"

  #ssh_key_storage_path = rundeck_private_key.anvils.path
  resource_model_source {
    type = "local"
    config = {

    }
  }
  extra_config = {
    "project/jobs/gui/groupExpandLevel" = "1"
  }
}

```

# Rundeck API Examples

In these examples I am passing my Rundeck authentication token and URL through
to curl as environment variables.

```bash
export RUNDECK_TOKEN=token-here
export RUNDECK_URL=https://rundeck.url.here
```

We'll start with reading (GET) a few things from Rundeck then move on to POSTing
changes to Rundeck. Note the API allows you to work with `XML` or `JSON` . We'll
be using `JSON` .

## Listing Projects

```bash
curl -s -X GET "${RUNDECK_URL}/api/30/projects?authtoken=${RUNDECK_TOKEN}" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

This will return you a list of projects, along with some information about each
one:

```bash
[
  {
    "url": "${RUNDECK_URL}/api/34/project/anvils",
    "name": "anvils",
    "description": "this is the description",
    "label": "your label"
  }
]

```

Now let's pipe this output to `jq` and filter the result to just show project
names:

```bash
curl -s -X GET "${RUNDECK_URL}/api/34/projects?authtoken=${RUNDECK_TOKEN}" -H "Accept: application/json" | jq '.[]| .name'
"anvils"
"anvils2"
```

## Importing jobs from a git repository

### Adding import settings

Note we are using key based auth in the example below:

```bash
 curl -X POST "${RUNDECK_URL}/api/30/project/anvils/scm/import/plugin/git-import/setup?authtoken=${RUNDECK_TOKEN}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"config": {
    "url": "git@gitlab.com:rundeck-job-template.git",
    "fetchAutomatically": "true",
    "pullAutomatically": "true",
    "dir": "/var/rundeck/projects/anvils/scm",
    "filePattern": ".*.yaml",
    "importUuidBehavior": "remove",
    "useFilePattern": "true",
    "strictHostKeyChecking": "yes",
    "sshPrivateKeyPath": "keys/rundeck-private-key",
    "format": "yaml",
    "branch": "master",
    "gitPasswordPath": "",
    "pathTemplate": "${job.group}${job.name}-${job.id}.${config.format}"
  },
  "enabled": true,
  "integration": "import",
  "project": "anvils",
  "type": "git-import"
}'

```

### Importing jobs

Once you've added git import settings to a project you'll likely want to import
jobs. You could do this manually, or you could run a script similar to the
below:

```bash
# Function to build post data
# We are picking up any jobs which have the status  `IMPORT_NEEDED`

generate_post_data() {
# Get list of jobs to import
  ITEMS=$(curl -s -X GET "${RUNDECK_URL}/api/30/project/anvils/scm/import/action/import-all/input?authtoken=${RUNDECK_TOKEN}" -H "Accept: application/json" | jq '[.importItems[] | select(.status == "IMPORT_NEEDED") | .itemId]')
  cat <<EOF
{"input":{
"message":"\$commitMessage"
},
"jobs":[],
"items":${ITEMS},
"deleted":[]
}
}
EOF
}

# Lets import our jobs
curl -X POST "${RUNDECK_URL}/api/30/project/anvils/scm/import/action/import-all?authtoken=${RUNDECK_TOKEN}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data "$(generate_post_data)"

```

In the example above we have a `BASH` function which uses `curl` and `jq` to
extract a list of jobs which have the status `IMPORT_NEEDED` ; the output of
which is then feed into the last `curl` command.

### Getting a list of jobs which need importing for a project

```bash
curl -s -X GET "${RUNDECK_URL}/api/30/project/anvils/scm/import/action/import-all/input?authtoken=${RUNDECK_TOKEN}" -H "Accept: application/json" | jq '[.importItems[] | select(.status == "IMPORT_NEEDED") | .itemId]'
"12345-789-abc"
"12345-789-abc"
"12345-789-abc"
"12345-789-abc"
"12345-789-abc"
"12345-789-abc"
"12345-789-abc"
```
